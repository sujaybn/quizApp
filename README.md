# Springboot Microservices Practice - Quiz Application

## Introduction
This project is a practice exercise developed using the Spring Boot framework to create a simple Quiz application. Currently, it serves as a backend application.

## Tools Used
- JDK 17
- Spring Boot 3.1.3
- Maven
- Postman
- PostgreSQL

## Scope for Improvement
The project has the following areas for improvement:
1. Implement DELETE functionality for questions.
2. Implement UPDATE functionality for questions.
3. Add validation and exception handling.
4. Read questions from a CSV file and populate the database.
5. Develop a front-end application for user interaction.

## Running the Application Locally
To run the application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this project to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse).
3. Ensure that Maven dependencies are resolved by running `mvn clean install`.
4. Install PgAdmin from [https://www.pgadmin.org/download/](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).
5. Create a database named **questiondb** using PgAdmin.
    - You can use the UI to create the database `questiondb`.
    - Run the following SQL command to create the `question` table:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE "question" (
       "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       "category" VARCHAR(25),
       "difficulty_level" VARCHAR(25),
       "option1" VARCHAR(255),
       "option2" VARCHAR(255),
       "option3" VARCHAR(255),
       "option4" VARCHAR(255),
       "question_title" VARCHAR(255),
       "correct_answer" VARCHAR(255)
   );
   ```
6. Run the `QuizappApplication`.
    - The server will run on `https://localhost:8080`.
    - Access all available questions at [http://localhost:8080/question/allQuestions](http://localhost:8080/question/allQuestions).
    - To perform CRUD operations, use Postman and send the following requests:
        1. **GET** `http://localhost:8080/question/allQuestions`
        2. **POST** `http://localhost:8080/question/add`
            - Payload example:
           ```json
           {
               "questionTitle": "This is one more test question for POST?",
               "option1": "op1",
               "option2": "op2",
               "option3": "op3",
               "option4": "op4",
               "correctAnswer": "op3",
               "difficultyLevel": "Easy",
               "category": "test"
           }
           ```
        3. **POST** `http://localhost:8080/quiz/create?category=Java&numQ=5&title=JQuiz`
        4. **GET** `http://localhost:8080/quiz/get/1`
        5. **POST** `http://localhost:8080/quiz/submit/1`
            - Payload example:
           ```json
           [
               {
                   "id": "25",
                   "response": "Option 3"
               },
               {
                   "id": "26",
                   "response": "Option 2"
               },
               {
                   "id": "27",
                   "response": "Option 3"
